### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sid (he/him/his).
I graduated from the University of Chicago with a B.A. in Physics in 2020. I will be going on to an NSF Graduate Fellowship in Physics at Stanford University in autumn.

My research focuses on using large cosmic surveys to learn about dark matter and constrain its properties.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on constraining different models of dark matter using the Milky Way satellite galaxy census.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to take better care of plants.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about physics, coding, applying to schools, Chicago, how to engage with your community, or anything music related!

Some software/tools I use:
- macOS
- Linux
- Vim
- LaTeX
- Slack
- Zoom
