### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sid (he/him/his).
I am currently an NSF Graduate Research Fellow studying Physics at Stanford University.
I graduated from the University of Chicago with a B.A. in Physics in 2020.

My research broadly involves using large cosmic surveys to study the properties and composition of the Universe.
Most of my work is done as part of [DESC](https://lsstdesc.org/), [DELVE](https://delve-survey.github.io/), and [DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/).
