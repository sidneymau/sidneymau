## projects

I work on shear estimation and PSFs to mitigate the impacts of systematic effects on weak lensing measurements.
I also search for ultra-faint satellite galaxies of the Milky Way and use their population statistcs to study dark matter.

I am a member of [DESC](https://lsstdesc.org/), [DELVE](https://delve-survey.github.io/), and [DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/).
