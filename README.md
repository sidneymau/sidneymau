### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sid (he/him/his).
I am currently an NSF Graduate Research Fellow studying Physics at Stanford University.
I graduated from the University of Chicago with a B.A. in Physics in 2020.

My research focuses on using large cosmic surveys to learn about dark matter and constrain its properties.
Currently, most of my work is part of the (DES)[https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/] and (DELVE)[https://delve-survey.github.io/] collaborations.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on constraining different models of dark matter using the Milky Way satellite galaxy census.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to take better care of plants.
