### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sid (he/him/his).
I am currently an NSF Graduate Research Fellow studying Physics at Stanford University.
I graduated from the University of Chicago with a B.A. in Physics in 2020.

My research focuses on using large cosmic surveys to learn about dark matter and constrain its properties.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on constraining different models of dark matter using the Milky Way satellite galaxy census.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to take better care of plants.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about physics, coding, applying to schools, Chicago, how to engage with your community, or anything music related!

Some software/tools I like to use:
- macOS
- Linux
- Vim
- LaTeX
- Overleaf
