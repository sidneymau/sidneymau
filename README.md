### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sid (he/him/his).
I am currently an NSF Graduate Research Fellow studying Physics at Stanford University.
I graduated from the University of Chicago with a B.A. in Physics in 2020.

My research focuses on using large cosmic surveys to learn about dark matter and constrain its properties.
Most of my work is as part of the [DESC](https://lsstdesc.org/), [DES](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/), and [DELVE](https://delve-survey.github.io/) collaborations.
